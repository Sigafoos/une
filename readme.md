# Universal NPC Emulator
From the rulebook (available for [pay-what-you-want at DriveThruRPG](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev)):

> UNE is a supplement for any pen and paper roleplaying game to help facilitate the creation and playing of a non-player character (“NPC”) to something  with the depth of a true character.  
>
> UNE is universal.  It was designed to be run with every standing genre in tabletop roleplaying.  Some terms must bend a little more depending on a genre.  The terms are not definite answers that restrict possibilities; they are ideas to get the creative juices flowing. 
>
> UNE is focused on the NPC aspect of a game.  With UNE, a simple NPC can become a true character in the story with just a few die rolls, and UNE can give that NPC direction of purpose for itself, towards characters, and even for the story as a whole. 
>
> UNE is an emulator.  It can be used without a GM, and some of the best results may occur when a whole group of players uses it.
